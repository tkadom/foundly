# Set site-specific values in this file.
# This file is used by the app_config plugin.
# Plugins are loaded before initializers, so values set here become global constants
# when the Rails start-up process loads from "config/initializers/app_constants.rb."
# Values set in this file are called in the application like this: Conf.site_url.
# Values set in the "common" section are shared among development, test, and production
# environments unless overridden in development, test, or production sections.
# Values set in a file "config/config.local.yml" override any values set here.
# See vendor/plugins/app_config/README for more information.
